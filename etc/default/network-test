# Defaults for ifupdown-extra testing scripts
# sourced by scripts at /etc/network/if-{pre-,-}up.d
# installed at /etc/default/network-test by the maintainer scripts
# while respecting exported shell environment variables

# Tells scripts to log to syslog the tests done before an interface
# is configured. Set this to "no" if you just want to use stderr
DO_SYSLOG=${DO_SYSLOG:-yes}

# Abort scripts (do not continue) if the network link is not up
ABORT_NO_LINK=${ABORT_NO_LINK:-no}

# Additional options that are passed to ARPING scripts
#
# DO_ARPING tells the scripts to test status through arping. Notice that
# this will introduce a delay when configuring the interface (if 
# everything is OK) since the scripts will have to wait until arping
# finished before configuring an interface. Set this to 'no' if you
# do not want the delay and want to skip these tests.
DO_ARPING=${DO_ARPING:-yes}
#
# These values control how many arp pings are sent when doing ARP tests
# The higher the count (or timeout) the more time it will take for those
# scripts to finish but it might make it more easy to detect faulty
# counditions in overloaded networks.
ARP_COUNT=${ARP_COUNT:-2}
ARP_TIMEOUT=${ARP_TIMEOUT:-3}
